Knowledge Check: How does strlen work without being given a size parameter?

We know that the parameter provided to strlen function is the string without size as extra parameter.

So strlen only counts the length of the string (without the null terminator '\0').

Starts at the beginning of the string (at str[0]).
Counts each character one by one until it encounters the null terminator ('\0').
The function then returns the number of characters before the null terminator.
