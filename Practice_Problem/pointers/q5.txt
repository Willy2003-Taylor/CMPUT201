Knowledge Check: What would happen if we hadnâ€™t switched the break to continue? 
What would happen if we just deleted break?

It depends. The function of break is to directly step out of a loop, and function of continue is to skip the current
loop and step in the next one.

Therefore, if for a loop that is needed to be stepped out under certain condition but we make it proceed one more
loop, which may cause unexpected error to the program.

Similarly, if we deleted break in certain condition where the loop should end, which may contribute to additional
loop, which may also cause unexpected error to the program.
